Theoretical physicist Philip (**Flip**) **Tanedo** is an associate professor at the University of California, Riverside. His research seeks to determine the fundamental physics of dark matter. He is a 2021 NSF CAREER award winner and a 2020 Hellman Fellow. 

He received his Ph.D at Cornell University as a National Science Foundation graduate research fellow and a recipient of the Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowship for New Americans. His thesis work showed how quantum effects in theories of extra dimensions predict new ways in which particles can decay. He completed his postdoctoral work at the University of California, Irvine as a Chancellor’s ADVANCE postdoctoral fellow. Dr. Tanedo grew up in Los Angeles and is a proud product of the Los Angeles Unified School District. He earned his bachelor’s degree in physics and mathematics with honors and distinction from Stanford University. As a Marshall Scholar, he completed Part III of the Mathematical Tripos at Cambridge University and a masters degree in physics at Durham University. 

Dr. Tanedo was appointed to serve as the theory/cosmic frontier liaison for the 2021 Snowmass Community Planning Exercise. He is the first Filipino-American professor of physics. At UCR he is an advocate for equity in academia. He led UCR’s team in the American Physical Society’s Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity Alliance, co-created and advises the university’s Physics Organization for Women and the Under-Represented, and was recognized by a 2020 commitment to graduate diversity award. He has appeared in Nova and Science Friday.
